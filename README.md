chatbox
=======
Chatbox is a real-time, well, chat box. It's mostly meant for online communities that want the ability to communicate with each other, and anyone else whom wants to communicate with them.

Chatbox is built on top of Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Redis. User storage is on Redis. Real-time sockets are provided by Socket.io. Web server is provided by Node.js and Express. Sessions are provided by Express and stored in Redis.

This repository is mostly for my sync across multiple machines - however, I may turn this into a project that is configuration-based. Anyone can fork this project and make their own changes - I welcome that whole-heartedly.
